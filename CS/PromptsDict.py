59.	A company sets up a data communication system between its branch offices using leased lines and routers. The network experiences delays and occasional packet losses during peak hours. The company’s IT department decides to analyze the issue by inspecting transmission delays, propagation delays, and the role of switching techniques and protocols used for error handling.
Which of the following best explains the delay that increases with packet queue build-up at routers during peak traffic?
(1)	Propagation delay
(2)	Transmission delay
(3)	Queuing delay
(4)	Processing delay
Answer Key: 3
Solution: 
•	(Incorrect): Propagation delay depends on physical distance and medium.
•	(Incorrect): Transmission delay depends on data size and link bandwidth.
•	(Correct): Queuing delay occurs when packets wait in the queue before being forwarded. This increases significantly during network congestion, as mentioned in the case.
•	(Incorrect): Processing delay is minor and occurs at headers inspection or route lookup.
Hence, Option (3) is the right answer.

67.	Consider the following two statements related to parsing techniques:
Statement I: LL(1) parsers cannot handle left-recursive grammars and rely on predictive parsing using a single lookahead symbol.
Statement II: LR parsers perform better than LL parsers in terms of grammar acceptance because they can handle a wider class of context-free grammars including left-recursive ones.
In light of the above statements, choose the correct answer from the options given below:
(1)	Both Statement I and Statement II are correct
(2)	Both Statement I and Statement II are incorrect
(3)	Statement I is correct but Statement II is incorrect
(4)	Statement I is incorrect but Statement II is correct
Answer Key: 1	
Solution:
•	I(Correct): LL(1) parsers use top-down parsing with one-symbol lookahead. They fail on left-recursive grammars because recursive calls lead to infinite loops (e.g., A → Aα | β). Hence, left recursion must be eliminated for LL(1) grammars.
•	II(Correct): LR parsers (including SLR, LALR, and canonical LR) use bottom-up parsing. They can handle left recursion, left factoring, and more complex grammar constructs. Thus, they accept a strictly larger set of context-free grammars than LL parsers.
Hence, Option (1) is the right answer.

46.	Consider the following statements:
Statement I: A queue can be efficiently implemented using two stacks, but the time complexity of the enqueue and dequeue operations may vary based on the chosen strategy.
Statement II: A circular queue overcomes the limitation of a linear queue by reusing vacant spaces created after dequeue operations, thereby optimizing memory usage.
(1)	Both Statement I and Statement II are correct
(2)	Both Statement I and Statement II are incorrect
(3)	Statement I is correct but Statement II is incorrect
(4)	Statement I is incorrect but Statement II is correct
Answer Key: 1
Solution:
•	I(Correct): A queue can be implemented using two stacks:
One strategy pushes all elements during enqueue, and performs stack reversal during dequeue (or vice versa).
The time complexity for either operation can be amortized O(1) in certain strategies, but not always.
•	II(Correct): A circular queue allows reusing the empty spaces in the array once front moves forward, unlike a linear queue that wastes space after repeated dequeue operations. This optimizes memory and is widely used in buffer implementations.
Hence, Option (1) is the right answer.""",

Which of the following statements about firewalls and intrusion detection systems are correct?
I.	A firewall can prevent unauthorized access from outside the network but not within it.
II.	Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can take automatic action to block malicious activity.
III.	Stateful firewalls monitor the full state of active connections.
Which of the following is correct?
(1)	I and II only
(2)	I and III only
(3)	II and III only
(4)	All of the above
Answer Key: 2
Solution:	
•	I(Correct): Firewalls primarily inspect incoming/outgoing traffic but can't detect internal attacks (e.g., an insider attack).
•	II(Incorrect): This describes an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), not IDS. IDS is passive, alerts admins but does not block.
•	III(Correct): Stateful firewalls keep track of the connection state and can apply rules accordingly.
Hence, Option (2) is the right answer.

Consider the following three statements related to Registers and Counters:
I.	A 4-bit Johnson counter cycles through 2⁴ = 16 distinct states before repeating.
II.	In a ring counter with n flip-flops, the number of states is exactly n.
III.	A parallel-in parallel-out (PIPO) register allows simultaneous loading and reading of all bits.
Which of the following is correct?
(1)	I and II only
(2)	I and III only
(3)	II and III only
(4)	All of the above
Answer Key: 3
Solution:	
•	I(Incorrect): A 4-bit Johnson counter (also called a twisted ring counter) goes through 2n = 8 states, not 16.
General formula for n flip-flops, Johnson counter → 2n states.
For 4 bits: 2 × 4 = 8 unique states.
A normal binary counter would go through 2⁴ = 16 states, but not a Johnson counter.
•	II(Correct): A ring counter is a circular shift register with only one bit set (1) and all others cleared (0).
For n flip-flops, the ring counter cycles through n unique states.
Example: For n = 4, valid states: 1000 → 0100 → 0010 → 0001 → (back to 1000)
•	III(Correct): A Parallel-In Parallel-Out (PIPO) register:
Parallel-In: All bits of data are loaded into the register simultaneously.
Parallel-Out: All bits are read simultaneously.
It is used in high-speed data handling.

•	II(Incorrect): FCFS does not guarantee minimum average waiting time (SJF does that).
•	III(Correct): FCFS is non-preemptive.
•	IV(Correct): FCFS schedules purely based on arrival time.

Choose the correct answer from the options given below:
(1)	I, and II only
(2)	II and IV only
(3)	II, III, and IV only
(4)	All of the above
Answer Key: 1
Solution:
•	I(Correct): Windows uses a hybrid kernel, which combines features of both monolithic kernels (like direct hardware interaction) and microkernels (like modularity). It’s not strictly microkernel or monolithic, but merges performance with modularity.
•	II(Correct): Windows uses a preemptive, priority-based scheduling algorithm for threads. Threads with higher priority preempt lower-priority ones and the scheduler also considers quantum expiration for fair CPU distribution.
•	III(Incorrect): NTFS supports file-level security via Access Control Lists (ACLs), journaling for fault tolerance and recoverability, compression, encryption, and disk quotas.
•	IV(Incorrect): Windows services can be set to start automatically during system boot (e.g., DHCP Client, Windows Update), and can also be manually started via GUI (Services.msc) or command-line (sc, net start). Hence, not limited to manual start only.

15.	Consider the following statements regarding pipeline and vector processing:
I.	In a non-pipelined processor, the total execution time for n instructions is proportional to n × k, where k is the number of stages.
II.	Vector processors use deep pipelines and are optimized for operations on large arrays.
III.	Instruction-level parallelism (ILP) is primarily exploited in scalar pipeline architectures, not in vector processors.
IV.	Pipeline hazards can be categorized as structural, data, and control hazards.
V.	In an ideal pipelined processor, n instructions complete in n + k - 1 cycles, assuming no stalls.
Choose the correct answer from the options given below:
(1)	I, II, and III only
(2)	I, II, IV and V only
(3)	I, II, III and V only
(4)	I, III, IV and V only
Answer Key: 2
Solution:
•	I(Correct): In a non-pipelined processor, each instruction must go through all stages sequentially. So, time to execute n instructions = n × k clock cycles.
No overlap of stages = linear increase in time.
•	II(Correct): Vector processors use deep pipelines and vector registers. They’re optimized for data-parallel tasks such as array processing, matrix operations, etc.
For example: Cray vector machines.
•	III(Incorrect): Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP) is also exploited in vector processors, especially pipelined vector units. Scalar pipelines exploit ILP via superscalar/multicycle techniques, but vector processors also use ILP efficiently for vector operations. Hence, the distinction is not exclusive.
•	IV(Correct): There are three types of pipeline hazards:
Structural hazard – due to resource conflicts
Data hazard – due to data dependencies
Control hazard – due to branch/instruction flow changes
•	V(Correct): In ideal pipelining, time to execute n instructions = n + k - 1 cycles, where k is the number of stages. This accounts for pipeline filling and draining.
Hence, Option (2) is the right answer.

II.	Hill Climbing algorithm is complete and guarantees a global optimum if the heuristic function is monotonic.
III.	Minimax algorithm assumes that the opponent plays optimally and is mainly used in two-player deterministic games.

(1)	I, II, and III only
(2)	I, II, IV and V only
(3)	I, III and IV only
(4)	I, III, IV and V only
Answer Key: 3
Solution:
•	I(Correct): In A\* search, the heuristic h(n) must be admissible (never overestimates cost) and consistent (also known as monotonic) to ensure optimality. This is a foundational requirement for A\* to always find the shortest path.
•	II(Incorrect): Hill Climbing is not complete and often gets stuck in local maxima, even with a monotonic heuristic. It lacks backtracking and may fail even when a solution exists.
•	III(Correct): Minimax is used in two-player zero-sum games and assumes that both players play optimally. The opponent's optimal moves are simulated to determine the best move for the player.
•	IV(Correct): Alpha-Beta pruning improves efficiency of minimax by pruning branches that won’t affect the final decision. It doesn’t change the result, only reduces search time.
•	V(Incorrect): Genetic Algorithms are based on evolutionary principles like selection, crossover, and mutation. They are not based on reinforcement learning, which uses reward signals to learn policies.

40.	A team of developers built an e-commerce web application using the MERN stack. During staging, they conducted performance testing using JMeter and identified issues with concurrent request handling. The security team later flagged improper session termination and vulnerable endpoints. Before production deployment, they integrated the CI/CD pipeline with automated testing tools and containerized the app using Docker. 
Which of the following doesn’t address the issues raised in the testing and deployment stages?
(1)	Implementing rate-limiting and horizontal scaling can improve concurrent request handling.
(2)	CI/CD pipelines alone are sufficient to prevent all security vulnerabilities.
(3)	Docker ensures consistent environments, aiding in reproducible deployment.
(4)	Proper session management and input validation help reduce attack surfaces.
Answer Key: 2
Solution:
•	(Correct): JMeter flagged concurrency issues; rate-limiting prevents abuse, and horizontal scaling (adding servers/containers) enhances parallel processing.
•	(Incorrect): CI/CD automates testing and deployment, but cannot guarantee complete security unless integrated with security scanners, code audits, or DevSecOps practices.
•	(Correct): Containerization guarantees that the application runs the same across environments, reducing “works-on-my-machine” issues.
•	(Correct): Secure session handling (e.g., logout, timeout) and input validation (e.g., sanitization) are crucial to defend against threats like XSS, CSRF, and injection attacks.

35.	A university maintains a single table STUDENT_COURSE with fields: StudentID, StudentName, CourseID, CourseName, InstructorName. It was observed that if a student takes multiple courses, their name and ID are repeated, and if a course is taught by different instructors over time, course-instructor combinations also repeat. After complaints about data inconsistency and redundancy, a normalization review was proposed.
Which of the following normalization strategies would best eliminate the redundancy and anomalies described in the above case?
(1)	Decompose the table into separate relations for Students and Courses to achieve Second Normal Form (2NF)
(2)	Keep the table intact, but enforce composite keys to satisfy First Normal Form (1NF)
(3)	Separate instructor data to eliminate transitive dependencies and achieve Third Normal Form (3NF)
(4)	Apply Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) directly to remove all types of multivalued dependencies
Answer Key: 3
Solution:
•	(Incorrect): This only eliminates partial dependencies, which occur when non-prime attributes are dependent on part of a composite key. But in the case, InstructorName depends on CourseName, which is a transitive dependency, not a partial one.
•	(Incorrect): 1NF only ensures atomicity of values and removes repeating groups. This won’t solve redundancy or update anomalies in the case described.
•	(Correct): This is the most suitable step. Here, InstructorName is dependent on CourseName, and not directly on the primary key. This is a transitive dependency, and to move to 3NF, we should separate course-instructor mapping into another table.
•	(Incorrect): BCNF handles anomalies due to overlapping candidate keys, but the case here is about transitive dependencies, not key overlaps. Also, multivalued dependencies are handled in Fourth Normal Form (4NF), not BCNF.

1. Given below are two statements, one is labelled as Assertion (A) and the other is
labelled as Reason (R).
Assertion (A): If a system is deadlocked, no process can proceed further until resources
are released. Reason (R): In a deadlock, each process holds some resources and waits indefinitely for others, leading to a circular wait. In light of the above statements, choose the most appropriate answer from the options
below:
(1) Both Assertion and Reason are correct, and Reason is the correct explanation of
Assertion. (2) Both Assertion and Reason are correct, but Reason is not the correct explanation of
Assertion. (3) Assertion is correct, but Reason is incorrect. (4) Assertion is incorrect, but Reason is correct. Answer Key: 1
Solution:  (Assertion is Correct): In deadlock, processes are stuck forever unless an external
action (like killing a process) is taken.  (Reason is Correct): Circular wait is one of the four Coffman conditions necessary for a
deadlock.

2.	Given below are two statements, one is labelled as Assertion (A) and the other is labelled as Reason (R).
Assertion (A): Dead code elimination helps in reducing the size of the executable file.
Reason (R): Dead code refers to program statements that are syntactically incorrect and cause compilation errors.
In light of the above statements, choose the most appropriate answer from the options below:
(1)	Both Assertion and Reason are correct, and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.
(2)	Both Assertion and Reason are correct, but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.
(3)	Assertion is correct, but Reason is incorrect.
(4)	Assertion is incorrect, but Reason is correct.
Answer Key: 3
Solution:
•	(Assertion is Correct): Dead code elimination is a form of code optimization where code that does not affect the program output (such as unreachable statements or unused variables) is removed. This indeed helps reduce the size of the executable and potentially enhances performance.
•	(Reason is Incorrect): Dead code is not code that causes compilation errors. It refers to valid but unused code, such as:
int a = 5;
a = 10;  // if 'a' is never used afterward, the assignment is dead code.
