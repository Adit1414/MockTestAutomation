   ```

   Or permanently (on Linux/macOS):

   ```bash
   echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **Prepare your syllabus Excel file**

   * Place it as `Book1.xlsx`

## üöÄ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

You‚Äôll be prompted to enter how many questions you want for each available type (in multiples of 5).

The script will:
